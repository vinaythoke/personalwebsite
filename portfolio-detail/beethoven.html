			<p>Beethoven Unbound - The Story of The Eroica is a book on Symphony by writer Allan S. Haley. Allan approached me with very clear instructions on how he has envisioned the look of the website. He wanted to have a book texture and colors used all over the website keeping the appeal and beauty intact.
